# What this is

This repository represents realistic capabilities of froniter LLM models as of late january 2026. The first steps were developed by Z.ai's GLM-4.7, followed by refinements by Qwen, then Gemini, then Claude.

## Summary of results
The goal was to see what it was like to be a project manager for AI agents, so most of the coding was done by the agents themselves (although I definitely got carried away with the themes a bit during review).
All in all, the agents performed faster than junior developers, but lacked the quality control of senior engineer. As such, I conclude that some hand-holding is still mostly necessary even for frontier models.

## Extrapolation
The good news is that local models are catching up FAST. Although this sort of code may seem trivial now (especially for a frontier model), I expect local models running on modest consumer hardware will start to match, if not beat the current state of frontier models in comfort (but not necessarily speed).
